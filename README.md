# UNO-Game
This code was for a final project for a computer science class for python (CS 1110) where we were tasked with coding a user playable UNO game. Using a separte created file for card class, the functions of the UNO game were created including adding the action cards (reverse, draw four, wild card). After each run of the UNO game file, the user is prompted to play on of the cards in their hand (a generated list) and after each move the code wiill return the following players moves and update you on the status of your game. A great way to practice uno or kill some time in your leaste favorite lecture.

To Play uno download this repo and run file a5_uno.py through python
